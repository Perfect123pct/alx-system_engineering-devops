    Fork the Repository:
        Go to the repository on GitHub that you want to contribute to.
        Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner. This creates a copy (fork) of the repository under your GitHub account.

    Clone your Fork:
        Clone the forked repository to your local machine using git clone.

    Create a New Branch:
        Create a new branch for your changes using git checkout -b your-branch-name.

    Make Changes:
        Make the necessary changes to the files in your local repository.

    Commit Changes:
        Commit your changes using git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message".

    Push Changes:
        Push your changes to your fork on GitHub using git push origin your-branch-name.

    Create a Pull Request:
        Visit the original repository on GitHub.
        GitHub will typically recognize your changes and prompt you to create a pull request. If not, find the "New Pull Request" button and click it.
        Choose the branches you are comparing (your new branch to the original repository's master/main branch).
        Write a description for your pull request, explaining what changes you made.
        Submit the pull request.

After submitting the pull request, the repository maintainers will review your changes, and if everything looks good, they may merge your changes into the main project.
